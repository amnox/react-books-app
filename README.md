# MyReads - A bookshelf app

The aim of this App is to keep a track of books a user is reading by letting the user mark them as read, want to read or reading, it also lets users to search books by name of author, genre or title and add them to their collection.

The app is made with react js and negotiates user data through Ajax calls. I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

To run this project on your machine:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* Make sure youre using node 8.0
